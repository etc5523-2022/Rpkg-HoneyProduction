# honeyproduction

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of honeyproduction package is to show summary information on overall honey production by state, average value by state, as well as a trend graph of overall production and a histogram of average honey unit price by state, to help people better understand the data.

The package documentation website is [here](https://etc5523-2022.github.io/rpkg-yche0537/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of honeyproduction from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2022/rpkg-yche0537")
```

## Usage

### Data

```{r data}
library(honeyproduction)
HoneyProduction %>% head()
```
Above is the subset view of the HoneyProduction data.

### Honey Production Shiny Application

You can also run the shiny application of the honey data by using below syntax:

```{r shinyapp, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
run_app()
```

### Honey production changing trend by year

```{r prodplot, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
production_plot()
```

```{r productionchart, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Figure 1: Honey production changing trend by year", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
library(ggplot2)

productionchart <- HoneyProduction %>%
    ggplot(aes(
      x = year,
      y = totalprod,
      color = state 
    )
    ) +
    geom_line() +
    theme_bw(base_size = 14) +
    scale_x_continuous(
      breaks = c(
        1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005,
        2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012
      )
    ) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5)) +
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Production(pound)")

productionchart
  
```
You can use the function `production_plot` to get the overview plot containing the curve of the change in the total honey production of each state from 1998 to 2012.

Specifically the output is the line graph of the honey production value for all states, regardless of whether argument has an input or not.

### Summary of Total Honey Production of US States(1998-2012)

```{r prod}
yearly_production(2000)
```

This `yearly_production` function is used for showing the summary information (i.e. minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum) of total production of US in the period of 1998 to 2012.

### The Average Value of Every State

```{r avevalue}
ave_value("AL")
```

This is a function that can calculate the average honey value that created by every state in US.

A tibble of dataset that contained the state name and mean honey value of that state will be the output.

### Average price plot of honey in every state

```{r priceplot, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
price_plot("AL")
```

```{r pic, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Figure 2: Average price of every states"}
knitr::include_graphics("price.jpg") #![Marathon](/marathon.jpg)
```


The `aveprice_plot function` returns a bar chart showing the average price of honey in each state, with selected states highlighted and others grayed out, meanwhile each state's price data displayed on its own bar.
